# router

Router has several responsibilities:

* Serves Envoy xDS configuration when `--atenet-router=envoy` (the default).
  Unless `--standalone` is set, it also manages the Envoy Deployment and
  Services in Kubernetes.
  With `--atenet-router=agentgateway`, the sidecar uses a static ConfigMap and
  atenet does not start an xDS server.
* ext_proc server for the proxy. To make the deployment and debugging easier, we will run this component together
  with the router, but this will be split later into its own component.
  * ext_proc will call into the ATE gRPC API to get the set of relevant backends (specific the worker IP) and
    route the traffic accordingly
  * Make sure the interface with ATE API is pluggable so that we can test with a mock ATE API.
* Runs an xDS server for the Envoy deployment that defines the Cluster information for the ATEs.
  * the xDS configuration will configure Envoy to send traffic to ext_proc
* Watches the ActorTemplates to get out the definitions for how to route the actor IDs.
* Parks requests whose actor cannot be served immediately due to transient
  worker-pool saturation, retrying the resume until the actor is routable or a
  bounded wait elapses, instead of failing fast. See
  [docs/request-parking.md](../../../../../docs/request-parking.md).
